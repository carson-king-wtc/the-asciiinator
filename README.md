## THE ACSII INATOR

it turns videos into ascii art! i got really lazy with making something to render it so i just made a really quick and laggy program in gamemaker lel

all you do is shove an mp4 into it, then it turns the mp4 from a goofy ahh video, then to images, then to ascii art

you could also steal this program for like a friggin uhhh video to image exporter or smthn but uhhhhh 

GOOD LUCK READING MY SPAGHETTI CODE NYEHEHEHE
